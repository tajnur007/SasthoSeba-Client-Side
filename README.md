# Welcome to Sastho Seba

This is an online based medical service portal project. In this project I didn't used any backend services. I used Firebase authentication within this project. You will not be able to visit some pages of this project without login. You can login using email-password method, Google, and Github login method. It requires registration first before login using email and password. So don't forget to create an account before login. It's very easy and simple.
